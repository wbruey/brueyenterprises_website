Conveniently located near the Q,F,4,5,6 trains, the Bruey bachelor pad is easily accessible disappointment for any of Manhattan’s 4 million women. Located on the beautiful Upper East Side, you will find the local area lacks fun activities, but brings a lovely residential neighborhood vibe, complete with sterile apartment buildings, and pretentious town homes. The best thing to do within walking distance is Central Park which just a few blocks away. The subway is almost always the fastest and cheapest way to get there from anywhere in Manhattan or the airports. JFK - Take the air train to Jamaica Station, then take the E to the F to the Lex 63rd street. Newark - Take the NJ transit to Penn Station, then walk to Herald Square and take the F to Lex 63rd street station. Actually, just use google maps like a normal person. Google maps is great with the subways, just turn it to public transit mode instead of driver mode. But word to the wise: Once you get 2 or more drinks in you, forget the subway and take a cab. Nobody wants to be drunk in a bright ass underground shenanigan situation and your ambitions are low enough not to care about the 18 dollar fare.

The doormen have been notified that you will be staying. Approach the front desk, identify yourself, and say that you are guests of Will Bruey and you want the keys. You will then be free to come and go as you please. You may need to re-identify yourself to other shifts of doormen. The apartment door has several locks on it. Way too much fault tolerance. Personally, I don't even lock the door. If there is a thief on the upper east side and he or she correctly guests the unlocked apartment door in a 42 story building after getting past the security personnel, then like, fine. That risk is way lower than the 800 dollars i had to drop to replace the lock when I locked myself out over the summer. But I digress. You will be given two keys, one with a black plastic top and a plain one. The plain metal key is for the dead bolt and the black key is for the handle lock. I'd highly recommend just using the deadbolt. No risk of locking yourself out, and the handle lock is complicated AF. It has like three settings, it's over engineered. I wouldn't touch the handle lock from the inside either. It owes me 800 bucks. When you are done your stay at the apartment, just lock the dead bolt and drop off the keys with the front desk.

There are three units that perform both AC and heat. One in the dining area, one by the 3D printed rocket engine near the couch, and a third in the bedroom. For each, you can open up the vent door and you'll see a set of knobs. Do whatever you want from that point. FYI the temp control sucks so consider it an open loop system. Please turn off all units if leaving the apt for an extended amount of time. Be advised that there are no shades in the apartment. I'm not going to pay top dollar for a good view and then cover it up. However, this design choice means that sleep can be an issue. There are sleep masks on the bedside table you are happy to use if the room is too bright, which it will be.

To use the SONOS, stand near in the middle of the living room and say "Alexa, play X from Spotify on Sonos" where X can be anything from "baby making music" to "Stevie Wonder". To turn off the Sonos: "Alexa, turn off the music". There is a dope NanoLeaf Light art on the wall. You can download the Nanonleaf app to control it, or unplug the white plug by the couch to just kill it. The TV in the wall is straight out of American Psycho. It has a raspberry pi behind it with an N64 and NES emulator so you can play video games. However, to turn it ON, you need to SSH into the raspberry pi from my primary desktop at my desk. If you want to play the arcade games give me a shout and I’ll walk you through turning it on. The bar is all yours, go nuts, get that drank on. Spare patron in the freezer.  The kitchen table is the only table in the house with enough structural integrity to dance on safely. There is a projector between the couch and the window. I usually plop it on the armrest of the couch and broadcast onto the triangle wall. It has a Chromecast connected to it so you can stream whatever. Board games are located in the linen closet across from the smaller bathroom. Finally, if you'd like to pull out the couch, it's easy. Simply move the coffee table out the way. Then, you will find a fabric handle tucked under the top of one of the lumbar cushions in the middle of the couch. Just pull that handle to pull out the couch. Sheets are in the chaise lounge portion of the couch. The butt cushion of the chaise lounge lifts up like the hood of a car. Pillows and sheets are in there. The terrace is where the magic happens. There are two cushions to the right of the bar that are the cushion for the two chairs in the terrace.

Feel free to eat any of the probably expired food found anywhere in the apartment. There is also a grocery store in the same building as my apartment (although you need to walk outside and go around the building to the other side to access the Morten Williams grocery entrance.) Toilet Paper is in the small bathroom under the sink. Feel free to use any of the toiletries in either bathroom under the sink. In the linen closet (across from the small bathroom) on the right shelf at thigh-height you'll see a box of dryer sheets. By that box is a laundry card. Above that box is the laundry detergent. These three items are all you need to get them clothes clean. The laundry room is the 2nd door on your right upon leaving my apartment. Also in the laundry room you'll find a trash chute and a recycling bin. There is a 2 amp iPhone charger on the bedside table. There is also a drawer under the east windows by the dining table with every charger known to man. If you want something from the doorman, use the phone by the door. Pick up the phone and press the button with the 'key' logo. It is located at the 3 o’clock position of the circular button array. Fresh towells are also available in the linen closet (glass door accross from the smaller bathroom).

As mentioned in the previous section, there is a grocery store in the building at the 63rd St. and 3rd Ave. corner (just exit apt building and wrap around the building to the right and you can't miss it). There are a few good restaurants in the walking distance. The East Pole is good as is the Jeffrey. If you want something fast, there is a “Hale and Hearty” for soup and sandwiches. "Eat Here Now" is a good old fashioned diner on the block. There is a Le Pain for classy breakfast munchies. Other than that, you'll want to leave the upper east side. The best restaurants and nightlife are in the West (Greenwich) Village. The west side also has some good museums. Midtown has some tourist attractions. Not much is in the financial district except the World Trade Center observatory and the 9/11 memorial. Only go the memorial if you are emotionally prepared for like 3 hours of heart breaking sadness followed by existential dread for another 2 hours. Central Park walks are great during the day, it also has a great ice skating rink. The lower east side is where NYU is and has a lot of college town vibe. Hell’s Kitchen has all the theatre stuff near Broadway and some lively fun bars too. Chelsea, the West Village, and the meatpacking district is where you want to go out to party. Cool cocktail bars include "The Up and Up" and "The Blond". Text me for whatever you are in the mood for and we'll find the fun.
